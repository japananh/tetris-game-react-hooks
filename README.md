I created a **Tetris Game with React Hooks**.

**How to play**: Click the start game button to play the game. Press left/right/down arrow to move left/right/down. Press up button to change the shape of tetrominos. Have fun!

Link to the game: [https://tetrisbyna.herokuapp.com/](https://tetrisbyna.herokuapp.com/)

If you find any idea to improve the game or find any bug, don't hesitate to open a pull request/issue.

Thanks **Weibenfalk** for his great tutorial and the useInterval function in React from a cool guy, which he used in his tutorial. You can find his tutorial here.
